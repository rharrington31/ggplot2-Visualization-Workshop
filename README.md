# `ggplot2` Visualization Workshop

Visualizing data is extremely important for exploratory data analysis. This goal of this workshop was to demonstrate simple techniques that are helpful for visualizing data as part of the exploratory data analysis process.

The dataset that was utilized for this workshop came from the State of Delaware's Office of Management and Budget FOIA Logs. The original dataset can be found in the `Data` folder. The cleaned data (that was actually used in the workshop) can be found in the `Data_Transformations` folder. The script that was used to clean the data is called `OMB_FOIA_Log_Cleaning.Rmd`.

In addition, this repository contains two files that acted as companions to the workshop. First, `OMB_FOIA_Log_Visualization_Workshop.Rmd` contains a mostly blank file that can be used to solve key questions about the analysis. Second, `OMB_FOIA_Log_Visualization.Rmd` contains a completed file that shows the solutions to answer those questions.

An interactive version of this project can be found at [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/project/282267).
